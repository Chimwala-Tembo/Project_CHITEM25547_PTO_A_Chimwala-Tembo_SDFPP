# 🧑‍💻 Personal Portfolio Website

This is a responsive portfolio website built with **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It showcases my profile, skills, projects, education, tools, and experience as I begin my journey into software development.

The project was challenging especially from a timing perspective, but helped me have an appreciation for some of the key concepts we have learnt over the SDF course.
